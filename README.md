# Excited-State Calculation and Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) Analysis

This repository contains a workflow that facilitates excited-state calculations using Gaussian, extracts dipole moment information using Multiwfn, and processes the extracted data with MATLAB to compute Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) properties.

## Overview

This workflow involves three main steps:

1. **Gaussian Excited-State Calculation**: Perform excited-state calculations using Gaussian and generate a formatted checkpoint (`.fchk`) file.
2. **Dipole Moment Extraction with Multiwfn**: Use Multiwfn to extract dipole moment information from the `.fchk` file.
3. **Data Processing with MATLAB**: Process the output `.txt` files from Multiwfn using MATLAB to extract relevant dipole moment information and calculate TPA.

## File Descriptions

This repository contains the following files:

- **`Step_1.txt1`**: A sample text file read by batchTDM.bat to the third step of the workflow.
- **`000006.com`**: An example Gaussian input file for performing excited-state calculations. This file contains the necessary settings for Gaussian to compute 20 excited states. Both .fchk and .log files required in this calculation.
- **`000006.txt`**: Output file generated by Multiwfn, containing detailed dipole moment information extracted from the Gaussian `.fchk` file.
- **`batchTDM.bat`**: A batch script to automate the process of running the Multiwfn analysis for multiple files. This script helps in analyzing transition dipole moments in batch mode.
- **`calculateTPAinbatchpar.m`**: MATLAB script to batch process `.txt` files generated by Multiwfn and compute Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) values. This script reads all files in the directory and extracts relevant dipole moment information for analysis.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Gaussian Excited-State Calculation

#### Step 1: Prepare the Gaussian Input File

Create a Gaussian input file (`.com`) that includes the necessary settings to perform excited-state calculations. Below is an example configuration:

#P TD(nstates=20) IOp(9/40=4) [other settings like functional and basis set]
TD(nstates=20): Specifies that 20 excited states will be computed.
IOp(9/40=4): Ensures detailed excited-state information is written to the output.
Functional and Basis Set: Customize as per your requirements (e.g., B3LYP/6-31G(d)).
Once the .com file is prepared, run the calculation in Gaussian to generate the .fchk (formatted checkpoint) file.

#### Step 2: Run the Gaussian Calculation
Submit the job to Gaussian, which will generate the necessary output files, including the .fchk file required for the next steps.

### 2. Extract Dipole Moment Information with Multiwfn
Once the Gaussian calculation is complete, use Multiwfn to extract the dipole moment data from the .fchk file.

#### Step 3: Open .fchk File in Multiwfn
Launch Multiwfn.exe.
Input the .fchk file generated from Gaussian.
Follow these steps:  
Input 18 (Excited state analysis).  
Input 5 (Analysis of transition dipole moments).  
Press Space to proceed log file.  
Input 2 to generate a detailed .txt file containing information about the dipole moments.  
After completing the steps above, Multiwfn will generate a .txt file containing all the relevant dipole moment information. This file will be used for further analysis in MATLAB.

### 3. Process the Generated .txt Files Using MATLAB
Once you have the .txt files extracted from Multiwfn, use the provided MATLAB script to process all .txt files in the current folder and extract the relevant information.

####Step 4: Run the MATLAB Script
Ensure all the .txt files are located in the same folder as the MATLAB script. The script will:
Read each .txt file.
Extract dipole moment information.
Compute Two-Photon Absorption (TPA) values.
